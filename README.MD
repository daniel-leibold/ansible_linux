# Ansible Playground

This should be a playground for ansible. Ideally it should help to setup and streamline my local ubuntu setup in a quick and easy way.

Guides to follow:

- <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html>

## Getting started

If you have followed the installation guide and setup ansible correctly you should run following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml main.yaml
```
